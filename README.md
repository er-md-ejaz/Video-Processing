# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO, Flask Backend & Dashboard  

This project integrates **YOLOv8 object detection** with a **Flask backend** and a **dashboard** for visualization.  
It allows detecting objects in real-time from webcam/video, storing results in a database, and monitoring detections via a dashboard.
